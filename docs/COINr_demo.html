<p>This is a <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto notebook</a> which combines text, code, and code outputs into one document. This notebook was created to demonstrate a few features of the COINr package, for the COIN week training 2023. It is not meant to thoroughly describe each step, but simply gives a record of some of the commands used in the demo.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>COINr is an R package for building and analysing composite indicators. Before going any further, here are some useful resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/">COINr documentation website</a></li>
<li>COINr <a href="https://github.com/bluefoxr/COINr/">GitHub repo</a> (where you can submit issues or suggestions)</li>
</ul>
<p>COINr allows you to build and analyse composite indicators, but the starting point is an (initial) data set of indicators, and indicator metadata, including the structure (conceptual framework) of the index.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this demo, we will build a composite indicator from scratch. The idea is to demonstrate also the principles of building a reproducible data pipeline, which is important for reproducibility, quality control and transparency. It also saves a lot of time for any future adjustments and updates!</p>
<p>Let us imagine a generic “Nice Country Index” (NCI). The idea will be to build a composite indicator that provides a summary measure of how “nice” a country is to live in. With the following very large provisos:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We only cover Europe</li>
<li>We only use Eurostat data</li>
<li>We select the indicators very much on a whim</li>
<li>We follow basic methodology</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, this is all just for a demo, not a serious index! With that said, let’s get started.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-collection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>One way of collecting data is to download it from Eurostat in e.g.&nbsp;Excel or CSV. Then if we are building the CI in R, we would have to import it into R etc.</p>
<p>A better way in many cases is to download the data directly into R via an “API”. R has many packages which provide easy interfaces to specific APIs - in our case, the “eurostat” package can be used to download Eurostat data directly into R. We will now use this to download our selected indicators.</p>
<p>Note that since this takes a minute or so, depending on the download speed, we will also save the raw data so that each time this document is generated, we don’t have to download again. This is effectively caching the data, but of course we always have the option to re-download the data if we suspect that indicators have been updated.</p>
<p>The following is how the data is downloaded. This code chunk will not be run except for (a) the first time we acquire the data, or (b) if we want to check for updates:</p>

<p>Notice that we reference Eurostat indicator codes (these can be found on the Eurostat website), and for each indicator we only download the relevant data using the filter options.</p>
<p>As mentioned, to avoid repeatedly downloading the same data, we will load a locally-saved version of the data:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>l_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">readRDS</span>(<span class="st">"raw_data.RDS"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point we have all the data, but it needs tidying up: our data covers multiple years, has different columns and may not always include the same set of countries. Begin by converting the list into one big table with common columns:</p>

<p>This shows the counts of years against indicators, and shows that the latest year with all 27 countries having data for all indicators is 2019. So we use that in our example.</p>
<p>To note that COINr can deal with panel data easily, but for simplicity we will stick with a single year of data, so let’s filter to that.</p>

</section>
<section id="formatting-for-coinr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formatting-for-coinr">Formatting for COINr</h2>

<section id="imeta" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="imeta">iMeta</h3>
<p>The other table requires some manual construction. We have to define indicator codes, names, directions, and the index structure. The structure of the iMeta table is a bit more complicated than the iData table, but it is explained thoroughly in the <a href="https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/articles/coins.html#indicator-metadata">COINr documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To be quick, we will just make the indicator names the same as codes for the moment. The following is the basic structure of the table which we will add to and edit:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>iMeta <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">data.frame</span>(</span>

<span id="cb10-8"><a href="#cb10-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next we will edit the directions: some of our indicators have a negative directionality (associated with lower values of skills).</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># indicators with negative directionality</span></span>

<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>

</div>
<p>Next we have to define the structure of the index. This is done by first assigning each indicator to its aggregation group using the “Parent” column, then adding additional rows to define the aggregates themselves (the pillars, etc, up to the index).</p>
<p>Defining the iMeta table may often be easier in Excel or similar, but here will do everything in R. First we assign the indicators to their groups in Level 2:</p>

<p>We will not follow the real ESI methodology here, but go for some very simple options in building the composite indicator.</p>
<p>First we will apply data treatment using a standard Winsorisation approach:</p>

<p>This table shows that only one data point was Winsorised.</p>
<p>Next we can normalise the data:</p>

<p>By default this uses the min-max method on the 0-100 interval. Finally we aggregate the index using the good old arithmetic mean.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This was a brief tour of some of the features of COIN. However, COINr can do many other things which we have not explored here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global sensitivity analysis</li>
<li>Effect of removing indicators</li>
<li>PCA</li>
<li>Imputation of missing data</li>
<li>Time series analysis (handling and analysing panel data)</li>
<li>Denomination</li>
<li>Screening units based on missing data</li>
<li>Reweighting</li>
</ul>
<p>… and many other things.</p>
<p>Overall we have demonstrated here how a composite indicator can be built from start to finish (excluding qualitative tasks like conceptual development, etc) in a fully reproducible way.</p>
